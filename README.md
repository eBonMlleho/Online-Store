Web App. Front-end: Vue.js. Back end: Spring Boot

## Introduction
Use Vue.js as frontend, while using Spring Boot as a backend. We build this website serve as a platform for users to sell their products. This middle-scale software provides practice for learning microservices and decomposing monolithic applications. Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks and workloads between server and clients. 

Spring Cloud Loadbalancer is a generic abstraction that can do the work that we used to do with Netflixâ€™s Ribbon project which are often employed to scale the server. Although peer to peer is getting popular these days, Client-server model can still dominate market for years. And use Spring Cloud to host our application to make more scalable is our next step.
